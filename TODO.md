- <del>keyboard utils</del>
- quad/placeholder tests
- PyxelEdit maps
- TextureAtlases (texture packer)
- add hitbox (depends if null, then use graphic).
- add collision detection
- add camera
- add touch top/left/right/bottom (for entities and tiles) as a component.
- since tiles are numerous, could use some sort of tile-proxy or interface objects to denote touchable sides top/left/right/bottom.
- mouse (click? hitTest? including rotations?)
- sound? as FJ#### what? FJBasic and change FJChild to extend it? So that world can use it? but why?
- lets make soundmanager/ audio a member of FG... or world.
