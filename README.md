FlashJam
========

A gamejam engine for creating games in Flash fast and easily. Ideal for Pixel-art style! This framework is also tested via a custom-made TDD library. If you find any issues, please use the included Bitbucket Issue tracker.


To do:
========

 - Create some simple Texture components for the FJEntity class (or derived);
 - Implement transforms (with rotation, scaleX, scaleY);
 - Implement TexturePacker (same format as Starling, for convenience sake);
 - Implement PyxelEdit JSON format and textures (standalone or from atlas);
